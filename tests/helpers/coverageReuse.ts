/* =============================================================================
HELPER: Reuse a covering test's outcome

PURPOSE
-------
Some report rows are fully covered by a longer test that already walks the same
screens (for example one user checking four checkout summaries). Repeating that
walk would cost extra sign-ups and Stripe checkouts, so the covering test records
each checkpoint it really completed, and the report row only confirms it.

Honesty rules:
- A checkpoint is recorded only after its assertions passed.
- A row passes only if its checkpoint was recorded in THIS run (same Playwright
  runner process), so a stale result from an older run never counts.
- If the covering test did not run or stopped early, the row fails and says so.
